# ACS WIL Data Analysis Project - Group 3

Stage 2 Deliverables: Data Preparation and Modeling
2-1: Data Preparation Deliverables:

- A preprocessed dataset addressing missing data points and encoding categorical variables.
- The dataset is split into distinct training and testing sets to facilitate model validation.
- Appropriate scaling techniques are applied to normalize the data, enhancing model performance.
  

2-2: Clustering Analysis Deliverables:

- The optimal number of clusters is identified using the elbow method.
- A K-Means clustering model is trained on the dataset.
- Resulting clusters are visualized and labeled for interpretation and actionable insights.

By completing these deliverables, the project team ensures the data is appropriately prepared and analyzed, setting the stage for effective modeling and predicting customer churn.
